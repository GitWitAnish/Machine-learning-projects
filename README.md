# 🚀 Machine Learning Projects — My Ongoing Struggle with Algorithms 😅

Hey! 👋

Welcome to my machine learning projects repo — a curated collection of everything I’ve built while diving into the world of ML.  
This space tracks my progress, experiments, and lessons learned, from the basics to more advanced stuff.

---

## ⚙️ What’s inside:

- ✅ Supervised learning (I tell the model what to do)  
- ✅ Unsupervised learning (the model pretends to know what it’s doing)  
- ✅ Regression, classification, clustering (a.k.a. *“why is my accuracy so bad?”*)  
- ✅ Model evaluation and tuning (AKA: me staring at confusion matrices wondering where I went wrong)  

---

## 🛠 Tools of choice:

- Python (the default language of ML sanity checks 🐍)  
- NumPy, Pandas (turning messy CSVs into something usable)  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn (making ugly data pretty since day 1)  
- Scikit-learn (the classic ML workhorse)  
- TensorFlow / Keras (when I’m feeling brave enough to enter the deep learning rabbit hole)

## 🤯 Current status:  
- 80% Googling errors  
- 15% Debugging  
- 5% Actually training models  

---

## 🎯 Why this repo exists:

Not to flex. Not to impress.  
Just a place where I keep track of what I’m learning, where I mess up, and where I (hopefully) get better over time.  
If future me is reading this: I hope you're better at hyperparameter tuning by now. 🙏

Active and growing.  
I’m continuously adding new projects, refining old ones, and sharpening my skills.
